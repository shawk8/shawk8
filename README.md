### - Hi, I'm David Pham
### - I'm interested in programming, racket sports, and video games
### - I'm currently learning how to take care of a dog
### - I'm originally from Honolulu
### - I'm a sophomore in electrical engineering
### - I chose my major because the world always needs engineers!
### - A fun fact about me is: I've lived in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Hilo
### - What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to learn more about programming (EE 160 was really fun!) and see if I have enough aptitude to continue further
### - A book or movie I'd recommend is: Before Sunset
